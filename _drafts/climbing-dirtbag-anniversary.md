One year ago I set out on the dusty trail of a dirtbag lifestyle.  That is, I (literally) sold off the majority of my worldly posessions 
to buy a trad rack, upgrade my camping equipment, move into my car, and set out endlessly upon the open road.

It's hard to believe that a year has passed since then.  The transforamtions that took place in that time were emense.  What started out as the 
beautiful dream of bountiful sandstone climbing in the southeast United States drug into a dreary wet winter and ineffable toils.  To 
summarize, I began with a dream (working three or four days per week, then disappearing to the hills) and as my love for my work grew, and 
threby my workload and investment in it grew, I ended as just another homeless person.  That is to say, by the end of things I wasn't climbing 
every day or even most days; I wasn't climbing at all.  I was just working obscene hours and living in Wal-Mart parking lots in my car amid the 
wet Georgia winter.

There are a lot of things I think I got really right about that journey, and many ways I went terribly awry as well -- both being profoundly 
educational.  Needless to say, then, this is a time of reflection for me.  Particularly so in the depths of summer and it's ```swampiness``` as 
we southern climbers know it.  Some folks migrate towards ropes for the summer, some boulderers just keep thrashing away.

summer = volume
spring / winter = performance

"the southern way"

"real southern crushers send year round, swamp or no swamp"
