This is a quick overview of the human body's energy systems or metabolic pathways as they relate to rock climbing.  Most of the information herein
is taken from a Power Company Climbing podcast, [Energy Systems Training with Eric Horst](http://www.powercompanyclimbing.com/blog/2016/8/31/episode-10-energy-systems-training-with-eric-horst).
There are also bits taken from an earlier podcast from Power Company, [Deadlifting with Steve Bechtel](http://www.powercompanyclimbing.com/blog/2016/7/17/episode-8-deadlifting-with-steve-bechtel-and-charlie-manganiello)
which also has great all around training suggestions.  Moving forward then...

#### Anaerobic - Alactic:

**Fuel Source:  ATP-CP**  

This energy system is responsible for short actions of the highest intensity.  Maximal output with this system lasts
about 10 seconds.  So, a short, hard boulder, or the crux sequence of a route, or a weighted deadhang.  Noted rest:work ratios here (Horst) are
anywhere from 10:1 to 20:1.  That means up to 3.5 minutes of rest for every 10 seconds of work.  If you're feeling pumped, you've stopped training
strength and have begun working endurance.  I've started using a stopwatch (app on smartphone) to time rests between hard goes on boulder problems.
If you have to ask yourself if you're ready to really try hard again, you're probably not.  On the other hand, it's easy to want to hop right back
on especially if you're working a short (~5 move) sequence.

Try hard and rest long, longer than you think.  The other energy systems may leave DOMS ([Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness](https://www.acsm.org/docs/brochures/delayed-onset-muscle-soreness-(doms).pdf)),
but as far as this system relates to climbing, it's far more taxing to connective tissues than muscles which tend to not tell you they're on the
fringe until it's too late (i.e. little warning before a tendon "pops").  This training can also be very taxing on the central nervous system
which doesn't give as clear indicators as sore muscles either (see below link on Maximum Recruitment and [this one from LiveStrong](http://www.livestrong.com/article/357690-central-nervous-system-lifting-weights/)).

#### Anaerobic - Lactic:

**Fuel Source:  Glycogen (blood sugar)**

This is the system associted with what's commonly called "strength endurance" or "power endurance".  Fristly, lets get it out of the way that
power is just strength with a time constraint; force (strength) / duration (time).  If what you mean by "power", or maybe you call it "strength",
what you're probably talking about is maximum recruitment.  In that case, re-read the above.

Horst describes the Anaerobic Lactic energy system to be the most difficult to train, however, that's a bit hairy in my opinon.  I've read other
places (forgive the lack of citations) -- and it has also been my experience -- that this energy system is where you can see rapid progress and
quick gains.  However, it is also the energy system that *detrains* the fastest.  Easy come, easy go and all...

As Bechtel mentions in the above podacst, the key is to leave this system "simmer" while you're "boiling" one of the others.  If you try to push
all three you'll at best get nowhere and at worse get injured.  At any rate, be thinking hanboard repeaters here.  This energy system has an upper
limit of about 2 minutes (Horst).  In climbing terms, that means 2 minutes to finish a long boulder or find a rest on a route.  

More good information in the podcast comes from discussions about lactate.  That is, "lactic acid" isn't really a thing.  Lactate is and 
Hydrogen ions are.  This was news to me as I hadn't really distinguished between "lactic acid build up" and DOMS; which I know now are not the same 
thing.  Lactate isnt bad, in fact, it fuels ATP production (that's the cellular energy we're using in this system).  However, the Hydrogen ions are 
bad as they cause a drop in your body's PH level -- making it more acidic.  Hence the burning pump.  There is great term referenced in the podcast 
-- "pump lust."  Not just climbers, but everybody (myself included) wants to "feel like they worked hard", but there's a difference between training
with a purpose and doing something just to feel tired / sweaty.

#### Aerobic:

**Fuel Source:  Oxygen (and fat)**

This energy system is used for intervals over 2 minutes.  It can take you up to several hours, but Horst recommends 10 minute intervals.  The 
rationale is simple, the system needs to be taxed enough to force adaptation.  So, how much capacity / work can you fit in to that 10 minute 
window.  The numbers cited in the podcast are somewhere between 70% and 85% of your max.  So, if you climb V10 that's V8, if you climb V5 then a 
softish V4.  With that information, the goal is a "controlled pump" rather than a "blistering, I'm about to fall" pump.  You should notice that 
it's taking some effort to maintain, but you're not getting "winded."

#### Putting Things Together:

| Energy System | Duration | Fuel Source |
| ------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| Anaerobic Alactic | < 10 seconds    | ATP-CP      |
| Anaerobic Lactic  | < 2 minutes     | Glycogen    |
| Aerobic           | > 2 minutes     | Oxygen      |

*"All recovery is aerobic."*  General aerobic conditioning helps regenerate the fuel (ATP and CP) required for the Anaerobic Alactic system.
Obviously, the stronger you are, the higher you're threshold is for completing a task of a certain difficulty (e.g. 4x4s) under certain time
constraints (Anaerobic Lactic).  That is, doing a 4x4 routine on V6 and V7 problems may be difficulty if your highpoint is V8.  Also, the more
total recruitment (strength) you can generate on any given move, the more your perception changes about what constitutes a "rest hold."  The
example in the podcast is a 5.14d climber on a 5.12a route thinking *every hold is a jug.*

#### Training:

Horst talks about a more traditional block peridization, which you can read more about in pretty much all of his books.  I was mostly 
interested in the "in season" or "year round" aspects.  That is, you could conievebly train all three energy systems within a given week and 
still be doing so efficently.  What you can't do (except for the very elite outliers) is train more than one (effectively) in the same day.

Another approach could be honest self assessment and tailoring your training accordingly.  The crux is that you don't want to loose your gains 
in the other areas.  So, it seems like it'd be a good idea to do some maintenance training (maybe once per week) to let the strong facets 
"simmer" while you "boil" the weakness.  

Steve Bechtel thinks the flatline for most people in a given facet seems to happen around 6 weeks with the lower end being about 4 
weeks.  That sounds right based on my experience.  Steve has a good point that 4-week cycles are very convenient for how we schedule our lives, 
but I'm hesitant to pass judgment on any training routine I haven't given a solid and consstent try for at least 4 weeks.  The more I hear the
concept, the more truth I think there is to it:  Progress "doesn't come fromw what you did in the last 10 days, but the last 10 weeks, or 10
years."
