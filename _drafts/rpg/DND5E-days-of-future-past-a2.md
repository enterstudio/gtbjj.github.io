*~30 Years before present day*


A wandering mortal mage (wizard) of unknown and questionable origins, but of great power abandons a child after the child appears to have been sired by an ice demon.  The child is raised by pirates who sail The North Shores and make their living raiding goblin caves deep within the mountian walls before seeking refuge in the open sea.

A young tiefling --still a child, but old enough to hold her own -- and her icey sorcery and manipulation of dark ethers and night vision prove useful to scavengers, theives, rogues, and outcasts.  For target practice she kills 3 goblins, though with a bit of struggle.

The tiefling (a young Digoria) is sent to explore a cave where she finds two giant spiders attacking a polar bear.  The spiders heavily wound Digoria, but the polar bear attacks and kills one spider and together the take the other.  Apparently Digoria's charisma saved face with the bear.  She decides to rest for the night, with the bear for safety.

Early in the morning Digoria is joined by the pirate chief (Azenar) and his first mate (Defarus).  Together they plan to attack a Hendurn-like Ice Witch, a banshee perhaps, who is guarding treasure.

Rogue and Chief flank, Rogue sneak attacks
Rogue lands a hit but is quickly frozen and killed
(shattered)
Pirate Chief engages and fights an honorable battle but
ultimately meets his end.
Ice Witch attacks Digoria but bear absorbs hit and dies.
An icey cat and mouse game ensues as Hendurn abandons her
ice spear for darts in an attempt to hit the shifty young
sorcerer.  There is an armageddon of icey shrapnel from
frozen magic missiles and ice darts flying through through
the air.
Digoria is severely wounded and about to die but remembered
she had just learned a new spell, Chromatic Orb.  Digoria
summons the last of her energy and hurls a giant frozen orb
at Hendurn.  Hendurn should not have underestimated the
young mage, as there arises a new Ice Queen from Under the
Mountain.
Digoria returns to her pirate friends, and leaves the
treasure, gold, rubies, and all loot to them, save one
thing… Hendurn’s quarterstaff
a very, very, long rest….

Crew divided about who should be captain of the ship, don’t
want child, let alone “she-devil”; others hail Digoria as
the “Ice Queen from Under the Mountain.”
Mutiny is brewing and tempers are aflare.  5 of the
remaining crew members square off against Digoria and two
crewmen who defend her.
The aiding crew men are killed, but so are two of the
attackers.  Digoria kills one of the attackers herself,
however she is badly wounded.
When all hope seems lost...
The ship is attacked by a...
Sea Dragon (Young White/Green Hybrid)
316 HP / 22 AC
Speed: 20 @ 1 x 9 squares
claw +11 v AC, 1d10 +4
bite + 11 v AC, 1d10 +4
breath 1d10 +4, miss = half dmg
coral tail 1d6 + 4, knocks prone
Who instantly swallows one of the attackers whole.  The
remaining attacker is shocked and stunned.  Digoria catches
him off guard and kills him.  The crew of the ...
Sailing Ship (NAME):
125 hp / 15
Speed: 60 @ 1 x 4 squares
Crew: 41 / 50 (<24 can only move)
2 port and 2 starboard cannons @ 120 +6 (need turns to
load, aim, fire) - each cannon has 60hp
-1 crew member / 2 hp lost
 Fortunately the sea beast is disadvantaged at this range
due to the ship’s cannons.
… panic and hurry to arm the ship’s cannons and prepare for
battle.
The Sea Dragon bites the stern of the ship as the ship
tries to make distance.  The ship fires and lands a firm
blow but the Sea Dragon retaliates with a critical fire
breath, setting the ship on fire, fortunately there’s an
ice mage on board to buy the ship more time as it readies
the other cannons and makes an about face, fires and
critically hits, and thus stunning the dragon.  The crew
take this chance to distance the ship from the dragon.
The cannons are all four loaded as the dragon moves in.
They’re loaded as the serpent rages closer.  Fire!  While
one backfires and explodes, three are direct hits!
With only a few crew members left the ship must choose to
flee.  They have range and speed on the Sea Dragon.
Digoria loads a cannon, loads the cannons as the Sea Dragon
moves closer… the ship is slowed by it’s limited crew and
and the Dragon will surely finish them if something doesn’t
happen soon.  However, Digoria imbues each of the cannon
balls with one of her magic missiles.  Boom goes the
snowball!
While the serpent attacked the ship Digoria pushes a few
crewmen overboard which distracts the Sea Dragon from the
ship.  It buys Digoria enough time to again ready the
cannon, but she does not have enough energy to provide
another round of magic missiles.  Not to mention the last
handful of crew members aren’t too happy with her now.
The serpent's aggression slows and it brings it’s maw close
to the only loaded cannon.  Wisdom, it seems, has not
impeded this particular seabeast’s hubris.  A Ray of Frost
propelled cannon shot lands squarely.  Wounded but still
wih the upper hand, the Sea Dragon coils the ship. It seems
the ship is lost as the Sea Dragon faces Digoria and a five
stowaway traveling warriors.  Soldiers at best, magic-less
humans at worst.
However, they bravely defend the young girl on board,
selflessly attacking the beat.  While their intentions are
noble and their battle just and their swords swung true,
they all ultimately met their fate at the teeth of the sea
beast.  The Sea Dragon snarled and breathed what seemed to
be a kiss of death engulfing what remained of the ship in
flames.  Alas, there stood a tiefling, not even shrouded in
ice, but unscathed by the inferno; due to her demonic
heritage one must assume.  Enraged the Sea Dragon bellowed
again as Digoria fired a final frozen cannon blast down the
Sea Dragons throat.  The beast lay slain aboard a sinking
ship.
*DM Note:  Tick XP as Young White Dragon / 5 last fighters
Land is not too far away, a mile or two.  While still
young, Digoria is experienced enough at sea to find a piece
of floating debris and drift to shore.  However, before she
departs the wreckage she draws a dagger, and removes one of
the Sea Dragon’s teeth.  “This will make a fine hilt for my
dagger.”
Follow Up...
(See Multiclassing Below)
All of Explorer’s Pack and Winter Blanket Lost at Sea, but
assorted gear washes up on shore amid the ship’s wreckage
Keeps Dragon Tooth Dagger, disbands the other for a rapier,
“mends” arcane source to rapier hilt (will have to wait to
learn to use this)
Multiclassing: (*Per DM, Multiclass @ Level 5)
Need min 13 in main stat to multiclass
This is not two level one characters, but overall level 2
Proficiency points do not change / double up (normal
progression for char lvl)
no saving throw proficiencies (for sorcerer - maybe for
other classes)
You do not get max hit points - average of both classes
Do not meta game (cherry pick features, “I want this and
that…”); multi class when it makes sense in the plot line.
Experience is split between class leveling - each class
levels independently and must split experience points.
Fighter / Eldritch Knight
