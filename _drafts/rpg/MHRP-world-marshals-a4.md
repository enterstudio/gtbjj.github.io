#### Scene 1:

Somewhere in a remote location there is bickering between another group of villains.  Norman Osborn, Mr. Sinister, and Carnage have gathered to discuss
the nature of their plans with Sebastian Shaw.  Sinister believes the trio needs Shaw for his resources and the technology he has acquired from black market
Stark Tech.  Osborn objects, stating that his intellect is sufficient and that the present three can cut Shaw out of their plans since he's decided to
"just go blow shit up a head of schedule."  

Sinister pauses and recalls his on-and-off feud with the Hellfire Club, which of course includes Shaw.  Carnage is willing to side with whoever will let him
cause the most, well, carnage.  Norman then points out that while The Lightningbolts are fighting Shaw, there's no one defending the rogue helicarrier that 
Nick Fury is riding around on -- that is, the base for the Lightningbolts.  

"Oh, and one more thing Mr. Sinister and Mr. Cassidy", Norman says, "I have a couple surprises for both of you.  As well as a couple friends."  Norman pulls
a veil off a table and reveals two goblin gliders for his comrades.  While they marvel and their new toys, Norman pushes a button which activates two Spider
Slayers.  "These two creations will be joining us.  I hope you don't mind."

*Que menacing laughter.*
