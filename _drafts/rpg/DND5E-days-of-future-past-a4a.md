~ 25 Years before present day
Many years had passed since Digoria’s voyages at sea and 
through the frigid northern mountains.  She carries with 
her a rapier sheathed on her back.  While she has not 
learned the art of swordplay, the pommel of the rapier is 
affixed with her Arcane Source, thus leaving one hand free 
and the other to wield Hendurn’s quarterstaff.
Digoria has survived on wit and clever trickery, drifting 
from town to town and making ends meet via an assortment of 
cons, deception, and thievery.
Digoria approaches the gate of the small village of 
Marshlow, nestled in the thick and foresty foothills.  The 
gates are open and it appears to be quiet town of commerce.  
Upon entering, there appears to be a large crowd gathered 
in the town square (which can be seen from the town gates).  
It appears to be some sort of competition as Knight is 
grappling with pair of Thugs.  It appears to be more 
sporting than villainous, routine knucklehead troublemakers 
more than sinister criminals.  Digoria nudges her way up 
through the cheering and jeering crowd.  After being thrown 
by the Knight, one of the Thugs falls at Digoria’s feet, 
appearing a little perturbed by being so easily handled.  
Digoria looks down and says, “It must hurt to suck that 
bad…”  
Losing his temper, the Thug engages Digoria while the crowd 
spreads to accommodate the new fight.  The Thug gets a good 
hit, but is easily confused by Mirror Images, eats a 
Chromatic Orb, then is blasted through the wall of a nearby 
building.  The other thug abandon’s his fight with the 
Knight and rushes Digoria from behind but stops because 
he’s confused by the remaining Mirror Images, leaving an 
opportunity for Digoria to attack.  Both fighters are a bit 
tired and sloppy, while the Thug is missing, Digoria lands 
several chip shots.  The Knight chimes in with a pair of 
heavy crossbow bolts, but ultimately the Thug is blasted 
through the same wall his partner was via Ray of Frost.
The young knight, appearing foolhardy as he is noble and 
brave, compliments Digoria on her tact, but not without a 
faint sneer in his voice.  Nevertheless, he (Marin 
Westlake) invites Rori to stay at the Inn where there are 
apparently a number of other adventurers and warriors 
gathered to contest for apprenticeship of a famed wizard 
who is rumored to be passing through the town tomorrow.  
While tensions and anticipation are high, everyone rest 
deeply and peacefully for the night.
At daylight, the town is filled with hustle and bust, the 
rumors were true.  Arthugh Bertreph has come to seek an 
apprentice.  Four fighters gather:  Digoria, Marin, Vega 
Inan (an elvish fighter), and Heley Atel (an elvish fire 
mage).  Arthugh asks for a trinket from each of the 
travelers and puts them in his hat.  Using his 
prestidigitation ability he casts a sorting spell that 
pairs the travelers for a “to-be-assigned” task.  The pairs 
are Marin / Heley and Vega / Digoria.  Marin and Heley set 
out on their task which is not told to the other pari.  
Vega and Digoria set out into the jungle-like foothills 
after being assigned to leave the town and search some sort 
of rare magical feathers.
After much searching, the setting sun casts a strange hue 
in the sky and the air is dense and hazey.  Digoria and 
Vega encounter a pair of Death Dogs.  The dogs spot the duo 
and start to close the distance, Vega (an arrogant pretty 
boy, but fierce veteran) charges towards them, but not 
before Digoria casts witch bolt and Vega attacks the other.  
Both dogs turn their attention to Vega, how frequently 
misses, but is quick with double attacks.  Digoria remains 
focus and shocks one while and Vega is able to kill the 
other.  A final surge from Digoria’s lightning and a heavy 
stroke from Vega’s long sword finish the last death dog 
off.
Vega and Digoria come to a lookout cliff over the sea and 
Digoria takes a moment to revel in the strange looking size 
and “burnt-purple” shade of the clouds in front of the sun 
and the wet-green haze rising off the jungle.  She loses 
herself in contemplative thought for a moment.  Then a 
white owl swoops down from behind and lands on a log next 
to her.  Their eyes seem to meet briefly before the owl 
flutters off again.  Amid the rustle of wings, a feather 
falls at Digoria’s feet.  However, Vega’s pride won’t let 
anyone else bring the feather to Arthugh, or get in the way 
of bolstering his ego.  Vega sneak attacks Digoria and she 
quickly casts MIrror Images to distract Vega while she 
readys a heavy Chromatic Orb.  Vega lands several blows 
with his long sword but Digoria returns fire with several 
Shocking Grasps which prove quite effective against Vega’s 
metal armor.  Alas, Digoria’s touch misses and Vega lands 
what appears to be a fatal blow (now double attacking with 
his longsword in one hand and a shortsword in the other).  
But, for the first time in Digoria’s memory, the Tides of 
Choas were invoked in her favor and while just barely 
conscious she casts a healing spell.  Vega’s next 
crushing-types stab attack misses and Digoria casts a 
Thunderwave.  Vega is almost certainly killed, but also 
knocked off the edge of the cliff and crashes into the sea 
far below.
Digoria rests returns to Marshlow just after nightfall 
where Marin and Heley are talking with Arthugh at the Inn.  
While Digoria and Vega were sent North in search of 
feathers, Heley and Marin were sent south to the marshes to 
retrieve a shrunken skull.  No one asks about Vega’s 
truancy.  Digoria’s still seeping wounds are answer enough.  
Arthugh senses some sort of evil presence and suggests 
something is awry with one of the would be apprentices or 
that their motives are suspect.  Marin loses his temper and 
storms out of the Inn.  Marin casually follows him.  
Arthugh notices the skull and feathers missing and uses a 
sly Mage Hand to lift them from Marin’s pocket without her 
noticing.  Arthugh asks Digoria to follow him outside while 
he confronts Heley.  Heley appears to have been a spy for 
some dark and distant evil, sent to either steal or gain 
critical information about Arthugh and his companion(s).  
After realizing she has been caught, Heley burns some 
magical items which creates a heavy sulfurous smoke.  Marin 
unknowingly breathes in the smoke and becomes possessed and 
turns his blade towards Arthugh and Digoria.  Digoria 
readies herself for battle, but Arthugh insists she rest 
because “this is his business.”  Marin is in a zombie-like 
state and his attacks frequently miss.  Heley’s fire is 
minimally effective against Arthugh.  A Cone of Cold, Ice 
Storm, and Magic Missile easily incapacitate Marin.  
Another Ice Storm brings Heley to her knees, but alas, she 
swears allegiance to her master.  Arthugh kills her with a 
single magic missle shot.
Digoria asks about Marin and Arthugh responds that Marin is 
noble enough of the heart, but weak in the mind, thus, 
Digoria must be the prodige’ Arthugh came to seek.
