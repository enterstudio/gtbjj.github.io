*~ 10 years before present day*

[Phage Elung](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2RH_BSaD6YPcC14Rmx1cFlNeEU/view?usp=sharing) 
came down from the hills with every inention of brining hell and horror
to the (mostly) calm and quiet people of Abenel.  She tried to trick two
guards outside the town gate to let her in under the guise of being a
weary traveler.  They are not foold and attack.  Phage makes short work
of them and rips the lock offf the gate with the aid of her Gauntlets of
Ogre Power.

Four unfortunate commoners are stunned by the vampire spawn standing
before them.  Two of them are killed before they can utter a sound.  The
second two make feeble attempts to attack, but don't last long against
*The Untouchable.*  Two guards charge at Phage from down the street.  A
third ambushes her from an alley behind.  There are some decent hits
landed.  but Phate insta-kills one guard with a fierce bite, bathing all
parties in blood.  The reamining two guards present some resistance, but
they cannot match the stamina of Phage's regenerative prowess.

Near the center of the town two knights are protecting the town’s Noble.  
There are a lot of sloppy and deflected hits.  The knights’ tough 
armor is resistant to Phage’s claws.   Phage is covered in grievous wounds 
but heals quickly.  Eventually Phage tires of not getting through the 
Knights’ armor, grapples with one, picks him up, and throws him against a 
brick wall.  Phage tries to throw a medium cart at the other knight, but 
the wheel breaks off and she throws that instead.  The first knight 
charges back since the second hasn’t landed a single hit yet.  However, 
a critical hit from a bite leads to the first knight having his head
ripped off.

At the gory scene of his comrade's death, the second Knight enters a rage 
and lands several devastating blows nearly bringing Phage to half life.  
However, Phage is able to grapple with and throw the second Knight.  He is 
stunned and misses on his next few attacks.  Phage is calmly able to pick 
up the nearby cart and smashes it over the second Knight.  Phage initially 
has no intention of killing the Noble, rather she wants to taste his 
terror and leave him to bask in the desecration of his people.  However, 
the Noble’s constitution checks to Phage’s intimidating charisma and he 
stands proud for his people.  He provides little resistance to a single 
bite from Phage.

Shortly after, the remaining residents of Abenel come out to the streets 
since the ruckus has settled.  They gaze upon a blood bath and look out to 
their harbor and notice a ship; and nearing their shore, a storm mage 
walking on water.
