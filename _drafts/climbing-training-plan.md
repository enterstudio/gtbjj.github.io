[Making Sense of Hangboard Training 
Programs](http://www.climbstrong.com/articles/20150220)
- more time at 70-80%
- avoids injury risk of 100% all the time

[Hangboard Training 
Basics](http://www.climbstrong.com/articles/20130122_1)
- pick 4 - 6 holds
- > 10 seconds is too easy
- < 4 seconds risks injury (too hard)
- hold for 4 - 10 secondws each
- difficulty increased by: smaller holds, adding weight, 
using one hand at a time
- the goal is to gain strength, not to get pumped! (rest 30 
seconds to 1 minute between sets)
- twice per week
- 4-6 week cycles
