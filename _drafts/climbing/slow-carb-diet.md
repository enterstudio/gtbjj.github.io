Let's start with the obvious.  Climbing is a war against gravit.  Body weight pounds are the Earth's gravitational pull on your body mass.  
Therefore, **less mass = less gravity you have to work against while climbing.**  It seems to me, thouh, that (like strength training) 
nutrition has the most effect at the ends of the bell curve of climbers -- that is, the very new and the very elite.

I don't mean to stay most climbers won't benefit from gerneally good eating habits (see [this 
post](http://www.climbstrong.com/articles/20130107_2) and [this one](http://www.climbstrong.com/articles/20130107_1)), but that our limited 
time is probably better spent elsewhere.  If you have to suck in your beer gut to tie in, is more time on the campus board the best use of your 
time?  In contrast Puccio and Woods (for example) have achieved immaculate technical skills and titanic finger strength, so their [adaptation 
potential](http://www.climbstrong.com/articles/20150401) probably gets put to really good use crosstraining with weights.

My motivation for this post came from being honest with myself.  I know that in that past year and half I've put on more than just a few 
pounds.  I had been turning a blind eye to it since I was still seeing strength gains and progress as a climber.  Saying to myself, I'm in 
*"decent"* shape and I'll worry about my weight when it become a problem.

Well, that time has come.  Near then end of the summer I noticed muffin top slipping over my harness.  *"But my fingers are getting 
stronger!"*, I said.  Two weeks ago I stepped on the scale (for the first time in at least two years) and had to accept the evidence in front 
of me.  

```
SIDE NOTE:  I would like to say that over the past two or three years 
I've had a very healthy separation from my body weight (specifically 
the neurotic and obsessive-complusive measuring of it).  Which was 
quite different from former unhealthy (mentally and physically) habits 
forged by many years in weight class based sports.

At any rate, I'm about 5'8" and I know that my peak fitness level (in terms of bodyweight)

#### Level 1

*Best For: Getting 'back on the bandwagon' after falling off, chronic roller-coaster dieters, re-establishing a baseline after trying a new 
variation / experiment*

- Breakfast: At least 30g protein and within 30 minutes of waking up
- Other Meals: Consists of *1 protein serving + 1 bean / legume serving + 1 vegetable serving*.  
- One Binge Day Per Week:  Start the day with a Slow Carb (above) meal, then enjoy yourself.  Limit this to one waking day.  Read the book for 
why this step is important and how to make it the most efficient.

#### Level 2

*Best For: Year round fitness, a notch up from Level 1, but not as intensive as and more sustainable than Level 3*

- Level 1 Implied
- GLUT4 Excersises: 60 seconds of muscle contractionsn before each meal and about 90 minutes after.  This is more for insulin control than 
specific strength training.  If at home, try working up to something like 50 push ups + 50 air squats.  If out to eat, excuse yourself to the 
restroom and to wall presses and air squats; or simply tense your body as hard as you can at the table without being obvious (ha!).

#### Level 3

*Best For: If you're a sedentary adult, if you're an athlete looking to hone yourself to peak condition for an 'in-season', training camp, or 
preparing for a singular trip / event.  I've found this to be supremely effective, but very overbearing on top of regular training and 
"recreational exercise."*

- Level 2 Implied
- Supplementation: AGG before each medal, PAGG before bedtime ([Amazon 
link](https://www.amazon.com/PAGG-Pareto-Nutrition-Month-Ingredients/dp/B004STCUDY)).
- Cold Therapy:  10 minute cold shower upon waking up and again before going to bed.  Let your body warm up  naturally, otherwise you're 
defeating the purpose.
