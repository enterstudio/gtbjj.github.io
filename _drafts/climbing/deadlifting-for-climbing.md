I've been an athlete for most of my life, and as such have been introduced to strength training (specificaly free weights, crossfit, yoga, 
etc...) along with that.  At one time I was even a very serious powerlifter, bench pressing nearly double my body weight (circa 2009 I think).  
When I started training martial arts (BJJ, MMA, Boxing) I shyed away from weights a bit because of their lacking specificity to my sports.  
When I started climbing, I began avoiding weight training all together.

In recent months, though I'm sure I've drifted through there before but, I've been turned on to Kris Hampton's [Power Company Climbing blog / 
podcasts](http://www.powercompanyclimbing.com/blog/).  One recent post features another training guru whom I've read countless articles from; 
and thus inspired my own post.  As with all my training posts I only spray the specifics of my experience.  I'm not trying to steal anyone 
elses work, so I'll greatly encourage others to give the original content a read / listen.

Bear with me, as I was taking notes from this podcast during a hangboard session :-D  

#### The Bare Bones:

- Aim for ~20 reps per session
- If sets take longer than ~13 seconds, you're not training power
- Plan on pushing for 4 - 6 weeks, then "simmering" or maintaining
- You're **not** trying to be an olympic deadlifter, men should strive for a 1 rep max of 2x their bodyweight and women 1.5x

#### Other Considerations:

*Lifting weights will give me bulky muscles and make me gain weight.*

> Yes, it will... if you're feeding them to grow.  In order to get stronger, your muscles need to grow to get stronger.  You need to eat for 
your muscles to grow.  After listening to the above podcast I immediately texted a dear friend, mentor, and very strong and well rounded 
climber to ask his take.  He said that deadlifts were very helpful to both he and his wife (also a strong climber), but "it's a fine line 
balancing sets and reps to not put on mass."  My jaw hit the floor.  I had to think carefully on how to kindly make the correct that that's 
actually *not* how things work.  Training (that includes lifting) conditions your body for a certain stimulus; be that running a marathon or a 
thuggy V-Hard.  Body composition is largely controlled through diet.  Please, don't get me started on the calorie-in versus calorie-out dogma.  
While it is true, it is only so at the most basic and drastically understated level exclusive of genetics, lifestyle, disease, metabolism, 
nutrient uptake / availability, etc...  The deadlifting podcast specifcally mentioned cyclists having large leg muscles -- perportedly as a 
result of tons of volume at moderate intensity.  The fellas forgot to mention said cyclist needed to be eating anabolicaly (caloric excess) as 
well for the muscles to grow.  Fortunately Hampton covers this thoroughly in [a much earlier 
post](http://www.powercompanyclimbing.com/blog/2011/08/hypertrophy-for-climbing-stronger-not.html).  Ever tried to get really lean and really 
strong at the same time only to do neither?  Exactly.

*You can't deadlift your way to being a better climber.*

> This is true.  You also can't yoga, run, or diet your way to being a better climber.  What I (explained in the podcast also) mean is that 
all those supplemental trainings have offerings that can do just that for your climbing; supplement it.  They will never replace it.  If you 
looked at any of those activities and got excited of thought "that's me", chances are you're already getting the maximal climbing benefit from 
them.  The best climbers in the world aren't out running marathons on off days and they're not winning power lifting competitions either. What 
they are doing is climbing a lot.  They're also breaking down their climbing to microsessions to fine tune specific movements rather than a 
randomized thrash session at your local gym every day.

*My feet cut on a steep move.  I need to work my core.*

> Nevermind for a minute that for most people "doing core" means a few situps / crunches; which is both ignorant and ineffective.  
Think more strength and stabilisation and less "burn."  Listening to the deadlift podcast makes this very clear.  The angle of force that your abdomen applies is very small.  There isn't a wide range of motion.  
Think in climbing terms.  You use your abs to help lift your feet up to a roof climb, but if you were to keep them tensed (like the top of a 
cruch exercise) you're butt would be totally saggy which is what you **do not** want.  Rather, you proably want heavy feet and your **hips** 
pushed up into the wall / ceiling.  This *hip hinge* activity is what is trainied in the deadlift.  Which actually does involve your entire 
"core" rather than an isolated muscle group.  Every time I talk about "core" I have to mention Mark Twight's video below:
