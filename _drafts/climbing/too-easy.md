Training Lessons

Came off 4-week anaerobic alactic / maximum recruitment / strength training phase

Important lessoned learned, you can go "too easy."

What happens when you train a very high volume at a very low intensity?  You get sore as hell and can't train either hard or well for several days... bummer.

Making good use of my rest week, I sat down to analyze my training and recalled [Steve Bechtell's 'Go Medium' post](http://www.climbstrong.com/articles/20150724).

I keep [detailed training notes](http://www.climbstrong.com/articles/20150313) just for this reason, not for bragging, or show-and-tell, just for the purpose of figuring out where I'm strong and where I need work.

Overall I had a good training block, but there was one week where I was particularly wrecked and struggled to catch up ground.  In theory I wanted to "boil" and focus
on one training area while "simmering" or maintaining another.  Specifically, focus on maximum strength, but also try to maintain endurance.

The catch?  I'm not strong or enduring enought to do that at those intensities in the same week, and I didn't pay close enough attention to crag time.

You best believe that (even) boulderers need endurance, that is, if you want to try hard all day long or for several days at the crag.  So when I spend 5 hours
or so at the crag every Saturday, that certainly is training my aerobic (endurance) system.  

The big foobar and take home point is that there were a couple training sessions in question where I did too much (volume) at too easy (an intensity).
Getting nerdy here, Bechtell provides a strength / volume distirbution:

| % of Max Grade | % of Training Time |
| 50 - 60 | 10 |
| 61 - 70 | 25 |
| 71 - 80 | 35 |
| 81 - 90 | 25 |
| 91 - 100 | 5 |

There is more to it than that, so I'd highly recommend reading the article.  But, generally, you're looking at about as may limit level problems as you are onsight
level in any given training session -- about 1 each for every 10 problems total.  Then, about as much time warming up as trying hard -- about 2 / 10 problems each.
  Finally, the bulk of your time on this regimine (4 of every 10 problems) is in the "medium" zone.  FYI, that 75 - 80% recommendation also corresponds to general 
cardiac threshold numbers (e.g. % of maximum heart rate rather than V-Grade; [[source](http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/HealthyLiving/PhysicalActivity/FitnessBasics/Target-Heart-Rates_UCM_434341_Article.jsp)]).

How do those numbers compare to my own training, or those two "bad" sessions I mentioned?  One session averaged 41% of my maximum grade, and the other 57%.
As for density, or anaerobic (lactic) threshold, they were about 10 - 20x more dense (e.g. v-points per minute) than my most instense (highest average problem) sessions.
