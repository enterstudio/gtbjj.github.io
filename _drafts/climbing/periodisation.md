#### Concurrent

- train every system w/in same week, only for most elite
- even elite train different systems in different sessions
- adaptation potential is limited


#### Linear / Sequential / Accumulation (Horst / CS)

(4) - 3 - 2 - 1

too big of gaps between focuses; one's always getting weaker 
while the other(s) are getting stronger

works bets for beginners who will benefit from virtually any
climbing-specific task and because low skill / strength levels
can be advanced simultaneously for them (e.g. we all know of steep
gains in the beginning, but taper off exponentially as we progress)

also good for planning a single trip or single season

not good for year-round climbing

#### Conjugate (TB / CS)

TB recommends 1 week, not enought time to know if you can stick with a plan

barely getting warmed up / building progress / momentum in only 1 week

CS - alternate linear may be better (3 on, 1 "off")
- alternate MxS and PE, have a focus, but 1x non-focus / week to maintain
- build volume throughout 3 weeks, then week 4 is half volume of week 3
- on week 5, start week 1 of the alternate focus
