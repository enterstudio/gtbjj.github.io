Android 7.0 ROMs are startint to file into the Nexus 6P Android Development thread on XDA so I took the Stock+ ROM for a spin to check out the 
changes.  here are some of the things that caught my eye:

*Multi Window / Split Screen*

*Recent Apps / Overview Button*

hold and double tap

*Recent Apps / Overview Menu*

bigger and fewer

*Notifications*

clustered and more seamless

*Quick Quick Tiles*

*Settings Summaries*

*Data Saver*

-----

#### Other Considerations

*Speed*

*Battery Life*

About the same, a little better ~3.5 hours SOT
