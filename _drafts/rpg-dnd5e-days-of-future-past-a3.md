~ 10 Years before present day
Gideon wake Digoria and tells her they have a “long day 
ahaead”; Derek stay sleeping; Gideon looks decades younger 
and has a glimmering aura about him
Gideon and Digoria set out further up the mountain in 
search of “a monster that keeps winter over the mountain”
Come to a castle belonging to “a thousand year old storm 
(lightning) mage and encounter two Gargoyles
Gideon lets Digoria fend for herself against one, tells her 
to be careful and suggests she’s young and impotent; she 
kills the gargoyle with four ice bullets and smugly says, 
“Just when I thought I couldn’t get any better.”  Gideon 
kills the other with a vicious fire palm.
Inside they encounter a Griffin.  After a tough fight, the 
griffin retreat’s to it’s nest in defeat.  Gideon convinces 
Digoria to let the griffin live as “they are known to bear 
gifts.”
Leave small castle and Gideon rests to meditate at a stump 
on an overlook and tells Digoria to continue
Dark, (rotting) stinking cave, investigate… very dim, need 
to feel around a bit
Fork in cave, fire glow on right, sounds of scurrying 
animals on left, go right, Step on swinging axe booby trap, 
axe swings from wall, misses but takes some hair
Fire smells normal, but there’s a putrid wet-laundry smell… 
waltz in but with caution… 4 goblins getting angry around 
fire, they’re sloppy fighters,
swat away some arrows w/ staff, crawling / dying goblin 
swings, stomp on blade, let another arrow slide by like 
dusting off just enough to feel the feathers on face; ray 
of frost w/ staff in eye socket… “shotgun splatter”; pencil 
ray square in the forehead, blows out back of head
Short Rest
Go back to other passageway, pass side passage to large 
cavern
animals in cage, small fire, 3 Goblin Bosss prodding at 
“bird-like animal in cage”
Digoria sneak attacks, chromatic orb to chest, sticks in 
chest; later, RoF into orb which pops Goblin Boss like a 
zit “pink mist” everywhere.
Twinning “Boondock Saints” Ray of Frost kill
Magic Missile quarters last Goblin Boss; 
Perception reveals that the blue orb found in the first 
treasure chest can grant one free spell cast; a 
pseudodragon is found in the cage.  Telepathic bond is 
immediately formed (w/in 1 mi) and resistance to magic 
(w/in 15’).  Digoria names the dragon Chuck.
Digoria lays down for a long rest.  As her eyes fall, her 
mind drifts to a time and place long since forgotten.  
Perhaps the spirits will awaken something potent from the 
past while Digoria’s new friend keeps watch.
