Somewhat reluctantly I've added ["donate" button]({% post_url 2016-12-04-donations %}/#donate) to the bottom of this website.  I 
want the content of my work here to remain add free, so donations support the time 
and effort it takes to produce content.  This is especially true of programming / 
Android / Linux content which can be quite time consuming since that is a 
hobby and not my professional trade.

Perhaps though, you're a fan of reading about my 
[wanderlust adventures](http://rockandcode.ga/tags/#dirtbag) or their related 
[Instagram posts](https://www.instagram.com/savagezen/).  What's the content worth to you?  Maybe it's worth a beer, a cup of coffee, or a gallon of gas.  Maybe it's worth the time to diligetly read and reshare.

#### So, where does your money go when you donate?

- 60% - Feeds me, funds my projects, and fuels my adventures.
- 20% - Donated to [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/donate/) as it is my distribution of choice and the focus of my IT projects.
- 20% - Donated to [The Southeaster Climbers Coalition](http://www.seclimbers.org/) who works to preserve climbing areas in the Southeaster United States.

These benefactors convey my secifc loyalties, for more general 
contributions consider giving to [The Acces Fund](https://www.accessfund.org/?gclid=CjwKEAiAmo_CBRC9qbGQssjqi28SJABYTgZxtdFhbvmeiWCMuh1nKS3KGxWLQsM5cCX8O35mChSrHxoC0nrw_wcB) or [The Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/).

#### Why not just donate to those organizations directly?

> I have contributed significant time and energy to both of those third 
parties over the years.  Linux through blogging, forum particpation, 
package maintenance, GitHub projects, and other technical support where I 
can.  I've given countless hours to cleaning up our crags and being a what 
I consider a [good steward to the sport of climbing]({% post_url 
2016-08-07-Southern-Way %}).  By donating here you're endorsing the 
practices I've undertaken as well as those parties I've chosen to 
contribute to.

As donations come in I'll eventually figure out a way to embed a public record of where the funds are going.
