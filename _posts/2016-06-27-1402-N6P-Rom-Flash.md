Previously I've covered:

* [Part 1]({% post_url 2016-06-26-1846-Rooting-N6P %})
* [Part 2]({% post_url 2016-06-27-1257-N6P-Recovery %})
* [Part 3]({% post_url 2016-06-27-1312-N6P-Root %})

After reading those, **proceed below at your own risk.**

1) Head over to XDA Forums and scower through the treads on either [N6P 
Original Android Development](http://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6p) or 
[Android 
Development[(http://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6p/development) until 
you find a ROM that suits your interests.

2) Each thread should have a download section where you can download the 
ROM.zip and a compatible version of GAPPS.zip.  You will want these on 
your phone.

3) Next, reboot into recovery mode.  Tap *Install* on the TWRP home 
screen, navigate to the .ZIPs you've downloaded, and swipte to install 
them.  You'll be given an option to wipe the dalvik / cache before 
rebooting, which is generally good practice (it wipes the ROMs app cache 
and gets repopulated at boot).

That's it!  Since this was a short post, here are some goodies to look 
into:

* A [Guide to Android I/O schedulers](https://androidmodguide.blogspot.com/p/io-schedulers.html) and recommendations for use.
* A [Guuide to Android CPU Governors](https://androidmodguide.blogspot.com/p/blog-page.html) and recommendations for use.
* Some apps I'm digging for rooting adventures:  [No Frills CPU Control](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.sineo.android.noFrillsCPU), [Voltage Control](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.darekxan.voltagecontrol), and [Helium](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=helium). 

I'm also planning to post reviews of ROMs I try.  Tentatively, you can view my [master raw data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KmZNyyYLXeVFufpmpVK-hl0sieGGy3hC5bjhIXYLU_A/edit?usp=sharing) on Google Drive.  We should all know by now that synthetic benchmarks should be taken with a grain of salt, so I won't harp on that or the hundreds of possible Governor / IO combinations for each each ROM.  Not to mention the sheer time to test real-world battery usage and such.  Perhaps, though, after I find a few favorites, I'll do some more in depth analyzing.
